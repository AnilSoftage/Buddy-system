The Buddy system is an onboarding strategy where new team members are paired with experienced colleagues, known as buddies, to facilitate their integration into the team and company culture. Buddies guide new hires, answer questions, and provide support during the initial phases of employment. The system aims to enhance the onboarding experience, promote social integration, and accelerate the acclimatization of new team members to their roles and the overall work environment.
